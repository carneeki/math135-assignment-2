\chapter{Question 4}
\section{Questions}
Hughes-Hallett \emph{et al}, 2013. Chapter 4, Section 3, Problem 42: \\
\\
\noindent On the same side of a straight river are two towns, and the
townspeaople want to build a pumping station, $S$. See figure \ref{fig:q4_map}.
The pumping station is to be at the river's edge with pipes extending straight
to the two towns. Where should the pumping station be located to minimize the
total length of pipe?

\section{Solutions}
County needs to order about 6.4 miles of pipe. An exact value is presented
following verbose working to solutions.

\noindent S, Town 1 and Town 2 are awful names. Let Town 1 be North Drysdale
and Town 2 be South Drysdale. Pumping Station will be named the Richard Nixon
Pumphouse\footnote{because it's a watergate.}.

\noindent Recognise there are two Pythaorean triads to be formed where the pipe
forms hypotenuse of both triangles to the Watergate Pumphouse. As given in the
diagram, $x$ is the distance from the intersection of a due North bearing from
North Drysdale to the river. This yields two distances.

\begin{align}
  \text{North Drysdale pipe}
    &= \sqrt{1+x^2} \\
  \text{South Drysdale pipe}
    &= \sqrt{4^2 + (4-x)^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{16 + (16-8x+x^2)} \\
    &= \sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}
  \intertext{Let Total Pipe be given by the function $p(x)$ such that:}
  p(x) &= \text{Total Pipe} \\
    &= \text{North Drysdale pipe} + \text{South Drysdale pipe} \\
    &= \sqrt{1+x^2} + \sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}
\end{align}
Now we seek global minima of $p(x)$. Using Mathematica, $p(x)$ can be plotted
(figure \ref{fig:plotq4_1}) using the code:\\
\texttt{Plot[Sqrt[1 + x\^{}2] + Sqrt[32 - 8 x + x\^{}2], \{x, -2, 4\},PlotRange $\to$ \{0,10\}, ImageSize
$\to$ Large]}.

  \caption{Plot of $p(x)=\sqrt{1+x^2} + \sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}$}
  \label{fig:plotq4_1}
\end{figure}\\
The minima is somewhere near $x=1$ indicating around 1 mile is good guess, but
a more precise answer can be found if we take find the derivative of $p(x)$,
and then the roots of $p'(x)$ should give us the exact distance for $x$. From
here we can also work out how much pipe is required.\footnote{Apologies if this
appears highly verbose, but I don't understand my own working unless I annotate
it.}
\begin{align}
  p(x) &= \sqrt{1+x^2} + \sqrt{x^2 -8x +32} \nonumber \\
  p'(x)
    &= (\sqrt{1+x^2})' + (\sqrt{x^2 -8x +32})'
  \intertext{Apply chain rule, let $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x)=(1+x^2)$ st}
  (f(x))'
    &= f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot 2x
  \intertext{Apply chain rule, let $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x)=(x^2 -8x +32)$ st}
  (f(x))'
    &= f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}} \cdot (2x -8)
  \intertext{Sum both derivatives}
  p'(x)
    &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot 2x
     + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}} \cdot (2x -8)
  \intertext{Collect like terms}
    &= \frac{2x}{2\sqrt{1+x^2}} + \frac{2x -8}{2\sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}}
  \intertext{Divide out the twos}
    &= \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} + \frac{x -4}{\sqrt{x^2 -8x +32}}
  \intertext{Cross multiply to make a single fraction:}
    &= \frac{\left(x\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}\right)+\left((x-4)\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)}{\sqrt{1+x^2}{\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}}}
  \intertext{Since we want the roots, we need to find when $p'(x)=0$}
  0 &= \frac{\left(x\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}\right)+\left((x-4)\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)}{\sqrt{1+x^2}{\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}}} \\
    &= \left(x\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}\right)+\left((x-4)\sqrt{1+x^2}\right) \\
  \left(x\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}\right)
    &= -(x-4)\sqrt{1+x^2} \\
  \left(x\sqrt{x^2-8x+32}\right)^2
    &= \left(-(x-4)\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)^2 \\
  (x^2)(x^2-8x+32) &= (-(x-4))^2(1+x^2) \\
  x^4 -8x^3 +32x^2 &= (x^2-8x+16)(1+x^2) \\
                   &= x^2 -8x +16 +x^4 -8x^3 +16x^2 \\
  15x^2 +8x -16 &= 0 \\
  \intertext{Apply quadratic formula}
  (3x+4)(5x-4) &= 0 \\
  x &= \frac{4}{5} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{-4}{3}
\end{align}
$\frac{4}{5}=0.8$ miles. The negative solution is discounted because it is west
of North Drysdale and South Drysdale is south-east resulting in more pipe than
necessary.

\noindent Finally, the total amount of pipe necessary can be found substituting
$x=\frac{4}{5}$ into the original equation,
\begin{align}
  p\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) &= \sqrt{1+\frac{4}{5}^2} + \sqrt{\frac{4}{5}^2 -8\frac{4}{5} +32} \\
  &= \sqrt{41} \\
  &\approx 6.4
\end{align}
Therefore, about 6.4 miles of pipe needs to be ordered. \qedbitches

\subsection{The Unique Solution}
In discussion with colleagues, one unique and interesting solution was
recognised, however it is rather impractical.
