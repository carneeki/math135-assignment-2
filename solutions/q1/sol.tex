\section{Questions}
Given is the function $f$ determined by
$f(x) = \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the natural domain $D$ of the given functional expression.
  \item Look at potential symmetry properties of the function.
  \item Find the roots of the function, that is, the points $x \in D$ where
  $f(x) = 0$.
  \item Asymptotic analysis: check for the existence of horizontal and vertical
  asymptotes.
  \item Investigate the behaviour of the first derivative.
  \item Investigate the behaviour of the second derivative.
  \item Collect the results in a table, and determine the type of the critical
  points.
  \item Finally, sketch the graph of $f$, using the previous table as a
  guideline.
\end{enumerate}
