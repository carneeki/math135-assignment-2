\section{Questions}
The function $\arcsinh$ is the inverse function of $\sinh$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the derivative of the function given by
  $x \mapsto \sinh = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$. Show that the derivative is
  everywhere (strictly) positive. Infer that $\sinh$ is injective. What is the
  range of this function?
  \item Use the definition of $\cosh x$ and $\sinh x$ to show that
  $\cosh^2 x - \sinh^2 x = 1$.
  \item Use the chain rule to find the derivative of the function determined by
  $x \mapsto \arcsinh x$.
\end{enumerate}
